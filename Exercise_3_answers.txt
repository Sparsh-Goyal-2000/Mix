At Step 14, We have already pushed from project 2 in the same repository and hence it has some changes that were not present locally, so push request was rejected from project 1. Now, I have pulled the changing locally and removed the conflict manually and then pushed to origin after commiting merge. 

At Step 30, As, I have merged branch testing into master, master branch is updated with the changes present in testing branch too.
During this merge, git found some conflict in test1 file, so we have to solve those conflicts manually and then commiting those changes, we get an updated file in master branch.
