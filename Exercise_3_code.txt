Create two folders project1 and project2 locally. Create a repository in github or bitbucket, name it test_project.

mkdir project1
mkdir project2

====================================

Switch to project1

cd project1
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/Sparsh-Goyal-2000/test_project.git
git push origin master

====================================

Switch to a new branch - 'staging'.
Add a file in it - 'test1' and add content to it 'This is first commit'.
Push it to github.

git checkout -b staging
gedit test1 => added line and saved
git add test1
git commit -m 'Added test1'
git push origin staging

====================================

Move to folder project2.
Clone the repo in project2.

cd ../project2
git clone https://github.com/Sparsh-Goyal-2000/test_project.git

====================================

Switch to staging.
Change the text in file 'test1' to 'This is second commit'.
Commit and push to remote branch.

git switch staging
gedit test1 => Modified line and saved
git add test1
git commit -m 'Modified test1'
git push origin staging

====================================

Move to project1.
Switch to staging branch.
Change the text in file 'test1' to 'This is third commit'.
Commit and push to remote branch. (Explain what happened here).

cd ../project1
git switch staging
gedit test1 => Modified line and saved
git add test1
git commit -m 'Modified test1'
git push origin staging
Error => origin changed
git pull origin staging
Error => Solved conflicts
git commit -m 'Merged with origin'
git push origin master

====================================

Switch to master.
Merge staging branch into master.

git switch master
git merge staging
git add .
git commit -m 'Staging Branch merged'

====================================

Create a new branch testing.
Change the text to 'A is an alphabet' and commit.
Repeat the 'step 18' seven times and each time update the alphabet 'A' to 'B' to 'C' etc.(Don't forget to commit the change everytime)
Push the branch to github.

git checkout -b testing
gedit test1 => Modified file and saved
